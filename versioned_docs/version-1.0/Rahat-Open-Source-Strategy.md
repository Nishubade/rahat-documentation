# Rahat Open Source Strategy

Open Source community has given many fine solutions. We, Rumsan team, are direct beneficiary of a lot of these software. We are big believers of paying it forward. Rahat is one of our few software we have developed that we want to bring it open source community. We believe, if we can save some software cost for the aid agencies that savings will flow to the aid beneficiaries.

Rahat is on track to be released as an open source solution by Q1 2021 We have just completed two pilot programs and results are very encouraging. We are currently studying different Open Source License options to understand and evaluate which one will be the best license for long-term sustainabilty of the software. Our goal is to take this decision by Q1 2021.

_The document currently work in progress and expected to be released in November - 2021_
