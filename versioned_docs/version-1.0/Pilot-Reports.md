# Pilot Report Overview

Rahat, which means relief in the Nepali language, is a digital relief distribution management system. Rahat uses mobile-based blockchain technology to enable relief distribution digitally by sending the digital tokens to the beneficiaries using a One-Time-Password (OTP) or QR code. Our system, Rahat, provides a very simple, efficient, and transparent process to support underserved communities, unbanked populations and ensure that they get the most out of the aid that is given to them.

In the last few months, the Rahat team carried out 8 pilots of aid distribution to many underprivileged and vulnerable communities. Our objectives of carrying out these pilot projects are to conduct relief distribution using blockchain technology to the underserved and unbanked population and test the operation, functionalities, and efficiency of the Rahat system. We also tested usage of QR codes and OTPs in rural and urban areas and assessed the practicality of CVA as an emergency response.

Till date Rahat has provided aid to 250+ households. We have collaborated with vendors, local mobilizers, and aid agencies during the pilot. About 92% of beneficiaries were satisfied with the process of the aid provided and were happy about the fact that they did not have to wait for their turn to collect their aid. Our biggest learning from these pilot projects was, social mobilizers add value and accountability to aid distribution programs so we built a social mobilizer app to delegate responsibilities and make the process easier. We also realized the need for language options (English, Nepali) in our app which would be easier for end-users to understand and use the app.
