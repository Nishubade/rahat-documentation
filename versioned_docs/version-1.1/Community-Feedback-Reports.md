# Community Feedback Reports

Rahat is on track to be released as an open-source solution by Q2,2021. We have completed nine pilot programs and the results are very encouraging.
We have received numerous feedbacks and suggestions from our pilots and Internal members.

You can view the feedbacks and suggestions in this file. [Feedback Report ](https://bit.ly/feedback_report)

We would like this solution to be owned by the community. We are open to ideas and suggestions. Once it goes open source, we will release community feedback reports every quarter on this page.

The document is still a work in progress and this will be updated every quarter.
