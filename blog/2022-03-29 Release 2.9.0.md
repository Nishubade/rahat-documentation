# Release 2.9.0 

Hello everyone, we are back with our monthly release. In the Month of March, we were focused more on documenting Rahat and minor improvements and bug fixes. 

## Rahat Knowledge Base 

In Release 2.9.0, we have restructured and released Rahat documentation site v1.2. The site will provide you with detailed information about Rahat from a technical standpoint. This document aims to be a collection of all Rahat documentation and unlike blockchain this is mutable.

The structure of the document has been inspired by various open-source projects mainly -  [https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/) and [https://docs.treejer.com/](https://docs.treejer.com/). Check these great open source projects out.
