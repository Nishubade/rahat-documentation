# Release 2.8.0
Welcome to Rahat’s monthly Release cycle. Release 2.8.0 is more focused on building a communication platform for your contributors and a few improvements and bug fixes. 

## Rahat in Discord
Rahat is an open-source blockchain-based platform working to create an environment where our community can effectively explore, create innovative and open aid distribution technology services that are inclusive, accountable, and accessible for everyone. We are a community of contributors - developers, volunteers, researchers, and the humanitarian sector including employees of Rumsan Associates.

Rahat has joined Discord in order for everyone to have synchronous communication. If you want to contribute, provide suggestions/feedback, or stay up-to-date about Rahat, you can join our Discord channel.

## Good first Issues for Starters
Rahat, being an open-source platform, we want everyone to contribute their work voluntarily to our project. So, The team of Rahat has identified some of the [good first issues](https://goodfirstissue.dev/) for our developers to make their first contribution to open-source.

## Notification feature

In Rahat 2.8.0 Release, we have added a notification feature for Agency App. From now onwards, agencies will be notified whenever new vendors or social mobilizers request for registration in Rahat.  They will receive real-time notification in the Agency application and the System User of agency app will also receive an email notification.

 ## Token issued SMS to Beneficiary

In the Rahat aid distribution cycle, the aid agency issues tokens to the Beneficiary’s mobile number. Previously, Social mobilizers or Aid agencies had to personally call or inform all the Beneficiaries about the aid distribution which was not efficient. 

Hence, Rahat has released a feature where the beneficiary will receive an SMS after the agency issues them token to their registered mobile number.
