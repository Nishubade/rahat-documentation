# Release 2.5.0 
Here we are again with another release of Rahat. You will find quite an achievement in our Rahat project in Release 2.5.0. Some of the major releases include NFT module development, wallet-based native vendor app development, Opensource licensing, and the launch of the Rahat Documentation site. 
 ## Rahat Open source Licensing 

We have built Rahat as an open-source technology with the belief that it will engage broader blockchain community in Nepal and abroad in aidtech space. Rahat is using mixed licensing. : **AGPL 3.0** for Stand-alone app , **L-GPL 3.0** for Reusable libraries and **CC- by SA 4.0** for Documentation.

## NFT Module
Rahat has integrated NFT Module in the ecosystem which is represented as a package in the application. Each NFT token symbolizes a commodity or group of commodities which will be distributed to beneficiaries. 

NFT( Non- Fungible Token) is a cryptographic asset on a blockchain that has unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from one another.NFT can be used as a medium for commercial transactions, however, this cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency.NFTs can be used to represent real-world items, peopleâ€™s identities, property rights, and more.

If we look at NFT in the Rahat ecosystem, we are representing it as a package. Aid agency can create a package/NFT that represents aid material or a group of aid material to be distributed to beneficiaries. Then the aid agency or social mobilizer will issue the package to beneficiaries using their respective application. Similarly, Vendors have an option to charge packages along with Token to the beneficiaries. This will depend totally on beneficiaries.

With the implementation of NFT in Rahat, we are trying to eliminate confusion between agencies and vendors by representing aid materials in terms of a package/NFT. 
## Native Vendor App 
Finally, we have developed our 1st mobile application of Rahat. A native-wallet-based Vendor App will be used by vendors to receive and send tokens of Beneficiaries issued by the agency. 

Mobile Vendor app is built using React Native and is currently tested for android users only. This app is the blockchain wallet on its core developed using ethers.js library and configured in a way to be used for rahat tokens only.

Vendors will create their wallet account as they register to Rahat. They will receive their unique wallet address. After successful registration, they can perform their transactions.

The current version of the Vendor app has fulfilled the basic requirements i.e. Registration, Charge Customer, and Redeem Token.
