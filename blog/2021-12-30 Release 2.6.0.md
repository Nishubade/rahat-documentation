# Release 2.6.0
The final release for the year 2021 from Rahat. This month Rahat team has deployed a native wallet- Rumsan wallet, improvised on Rahat application code coverage, auto-deployement feature and minor User Experience improvements. 

## Native Rumsan Wallet App

Rumsan wallet is an integral part of Rahat’s application. It is used by the Rahat Agency to log in to the Agency app and to sign the transaction. In this release, we have deployed the Android application of the Rumsan wallet. 

Rumsan wallet is used by the users of the agency to log in to the Agency app. It is a digital signature base (password-less unique digital signature/identifier) that provides a unique identifier to the aid agency. 

The application is still in the development stage. However, we have deployed major functionalities of the wallet. You can create your wallet, Sign in to a connected Desktop/web application, and Send tokens to another wallet address. 

To know more about Rumsan wallet, you can go through the [Rumsan Digital Wallet Blog](https://rahat.io/blogs/rahat-rumsan-digital-wallet/). 

## Automated Deployment: Cloudfare

As we all know, all the Rahat Application is managed in Github which can be accessed by Cloudflare. We have connected our [rahat-agency](<https://github.com/esatya/rahat-agency>) repository to the Continuous Integration Service.

With this integration, It instantly re-deploys our app with the changes that we made. As our deployment is taking place, we can hit "View build" and can see specific information about this deployment, along with any logs. Moreover, Github provides you, its own unique deploy hash at the beginning of the URL which lets us uniquely reference each deployment

## Default community health file management 

As mentioned in the previous release, Rahat is an open-source project with mixed licensing. We welcome anyone to contribute to our project. In order to coordinate with our contributors, there are community health files such as Issue template, Code of Conduct in our repositories which are managed by the .github folder. 

[`.github`](https://github.com/esatya/.github) is just a convention folder used to place Github-related stuff inside it. Currently, the Rahat .github folder consists of Issue Templates, Code of Conduct.md, and Contributing.md file. This .github folder is linked to all the repositories of Rahat. 

## Enhanced Quality Assurance

Rahat team has been constantly working on building better software quality Rahat applications. The developers have upgraded the codebase of Rahat. To test the code coverage of the Application, we have used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

This enhancement has helped us identify the vulnerabilities of the Rahat application, eliminate the unnecessary codes and identify missing codes.
