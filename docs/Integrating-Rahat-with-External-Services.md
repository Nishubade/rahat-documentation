# Integrating Rahat with External Services

To make Rahat more useful for aid agencies and organizations, it is necessary for Rahat to integrate with other services that organizations have already been using tools such as KoboToolbox, Google Sheet, and Excel. This integration is planned to happen in the second quarter of 2021. We will keep updating this document with more information as we do more research.

The document currently is a work in progress and is expected to be updated with the full requirements by November 2021.
