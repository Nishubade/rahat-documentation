# Rahat Crowd Fundraise Module

## A Decentralized Fundraiser

Decentralized fundraising is one of the very compelling use cases for Rahat. During an emergency, beneficiary or local organizations on behalf of the beneficiaries can register to Rahat to request relief from donors globally. Donors can read about the need and donate to the beneficiary directly, without having to go through multiple organizations in the middle. The fund will instantly be transferred through the blockchain network. Blockchain will make the whole process secure and efficient along with cheaper or free transaction fees.
